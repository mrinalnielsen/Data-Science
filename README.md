This project was undertaken to understand the nuances of Bayesian Regression, which is used in Google Lightweight MMM. The data for this project has been taken from Kaggle, namely the bike sales dataset.

The problem statement is to estimate the effect different media channels have on the sales, and therafter calculate the Return on Investment and Contributions of those media channels ( which is a standard delivarable of any Market Mix Modeling project)

Return on Investment means that if the client is spending $1 on a particular media channel, how much revenue is it making after spending that one dollar. (ROI of greater than 1 means that after spending that one dollar, the client is making more than one dollar in revenue)

Contribution = Media Channel Revenue / Total Revenue.
